<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## How To Play

_Yper_ is a typing game written in python using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) Module

The objective is to type the words shown as quickly as you can. You can only start writting the next once you've typed **every character** of the current word correctly.

At the end you'll be presented with your calculated WPM (Words Per Minute) and Accuracy
